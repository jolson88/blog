I'm a geek. I love learning about different programming languages. It doesn't matter whether they are new or old. I especially love programming languages that add bring something unique to the table.

# Unique programming languages of the past
TODO (Intro)

TODO (Lisp)

TODO (Smalltalk)

TODO (Prolog)

TODO (Forth)

TODO (APL)

TODO (Prolog)

TODO (Erlang)

TODO (Haskell)

TODO (Sketchpad)

But where do we find ourselves today? How innovative are our programming languages? How unique are they from each other?

# Kitchen Sinks... Kitchen Sinks Everywhere

"Sadly, it feels like we've entered "kitchen sink" language time over the last 10+ years where each language is evolving into a homogenous goo of language features torn from other languages they are envious of. Less refining, more amalgamating."

"I want languages to embrace their uniqueness and refine themselves into their true essences (striving for simplicity with each successive release). But they seem to lose sight of their value and just try to become the definitive "multi-paradigm" lang of choice."
""

But this could just be me. I like fresh perspectives. I like new ways of thinking. I like languages that push the boundary. They just seem so darned few and far between now. I swear, sometimes it feels like I should have been born 20-30 years earlier than I was!
