TODO (Talking bad about others; negative emotions/thoughts; very viral and spreads)

# Don't compare yourself to others
TODO (beware of feelings of inadequacy; competitiveness/wanting to do better than others; closes off ourselves from learning from others; it's about the journey (growth vs. fixed mindset), focus on the journey not the destination)

# Don't judge others from their mistakes
TODO (safe environment; mistakes aren't bad; mistakes are a sign of growth; if you aren't making mistakes, you aren't pushing yourself hard enough; )
