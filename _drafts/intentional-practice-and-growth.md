TODO: Growth mindset and having a "learning focus". What does it mean to have a learning focus and being intentional about your own growth?

TODO: The "Five Hour Rule" (used by Ben Franklin and others)

TODO: mention of "slack time", building learning into your day directly rather than be reactive. LOVE the example of what skills to practice on a call, lessons learned, etc. How can I apply that to my own growth?

TODO: Devising skills you want to work on. Find ways you can explicitly practice those skills (and have time to reflect on what you learned during practice). 

TODO: Practice can be woven into the fabric of your existing day. Doesn't need to be explicitly set aside in isolation. "Every event is an opportunity to improve." (from the article above)
