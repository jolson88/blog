Based on these tweets of mine:
""A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing." (Perlis). This is why I like learning about Erlang, Smalltalk, Lisp, Haskell, Prolog, Self, Forth, APL, etc. Many langs today feel just like mashups of Algol + concepts from the above list"
"Sadly, it feels like we've entered "kitchen sink" language time over the last 10+ years where each language is evolving into a homogenous goo of language features torn from other languages they are envious of. Less refining, more amalgamating."
"I want languages to embrace their uniqueness and refine themselves into their true essences (striving for simplicity with each successive release). But they seem to lose sight of their value and just try to become the definitive "multi-paradigm" lang of choice."
