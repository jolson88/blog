This is going to be a very personal post. I'm going to mention numbers, habits, and details that I'm quite embarrassed or ashamed about. But I feel it's the right time to share my story with others and to share the steps that I've taken to get my health back on track. I wanted to wait to write this until new habits have been formed and feel like I'm on track. That time has come.

# So who am I?
I've never been a fit person before. Ever since 5th grade on, I've always been on the larger side and had low self-esteem issues that arose from it. As my life continued on, my health continued to slide lower and lower. I've had an unhealthy relationship with food for as long as I can remember, and have never really focused on taking care of myself.

I'm a living example of the sheer overabundance we are faced with in the modern world. We have nearly immediate access to anything we could possibly want at any possible time. We have stocked fridges, stocked pantry cupboards, 24 hour restaurants and stores, drive-thru food where we don't even have to leave the comfort of our own car, or food delivery services where we don't even need to leave the comfort of our own couch. We can get same-day delivery with Amazon Prime, or even never have to leave the house to work.

I've had many people over the years express concern for my health. But change has to come within. Otherwise, it is short-lived. I had to find my own inner motivation to get the ball rolling. My long bout with depression and anxiety hasn't helped for sure. Through it all, I never really embraced life for the miracle it is. I never took the time to define what I care most about. In some ways, perhaps I never felt worthy of deserving a life of good health.

As I write this post, I finally feel like I'm not depressed at all. With help from my physician, I got on a medication that took off the edge of my depression and anxiety enough to make the changes in my life I've long needed to. With help of my therapist, I've started exploring the things that I care deeply about and the impact I want my life to have in the world.

I suppose, I could say that I'm finally finding my own inner drive and will to live. And it feels great.

After getting a wrist band to track my physical activity, I found that it wasn't uncommon for me to take fewer than 400 steps in a day. I might as well have just stayed in bed all day. I was drowning myself with inactivity. My body and mind was just languishing. It's no wonder I was dealing with depression and anxiety.

# How I finally made changes
TODO (baby steps; this was a lifestyle change, needed to be able to keep it up)

TODO (designing your life for happiness)

TODO (baby step examples: no soda, less fast-food, more salads, 800 steps at work -> 1k -> 1.25k. again, "making more good decisions than bad")

TODO (tools: myfitnesspal, premade salads, soylent)

TODO (first focus: eating habits and calorie counting; next: walking; future: lean muscle mass / bodyweight exercises)

TODO (needed to focus on mental health as well; counseling, mindfulness/meditation, medication, sleep)

# Some next steps I'm making
TODO (intermittent fasting, 7-minute workout (while fasted), longer-term: strength training)
