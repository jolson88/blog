TODO (topic about how mistakes aren't bad)

TODO (a healthy work culture should not shun mistakes; to grow in both business and your personal life, you have to challenge yourself; when you change yourself, you will naturally make mistakes as you push yourself out of your comfort zone).

TODO (the important part is learning from your mistakes)

TODO (if employees are constantly worried about making mistakes and getting in trouble, they are NOT going to be giving you their best effort or best work)

TODO (Toxicity of risk-averse companies; junior employees being fired for doing something that they shouldn't have been able to do in the first place (find story of new employee deleting production database))

TODO (If there are areas that are mission-critical, make sure people know; identify an area that is lower-risk where employees are encouraged to take risks and innovate; reference Multipliers book here)
