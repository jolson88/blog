I'm feeling very reflective lately and find myself growing more saddened by companies that are built on a culture of blame instead of learning. There's been [no shortage of stories](https://thenewstack.io/junior-dev-deleted-production-database/) that show junior employees being held accountable for making mistakes, mistakes that they shouldn't have likely been able to make in the first place.

Sadly, management at many of these places don't realize the damage they are causing by taking such a strong stance on making mistakes. 

# Mistakes aren't bad!
Let's get this out of the way right away: Mistakes Aren't Bad. Mistakes should lead to learning and positive growth. Most companies should embrace a culture where learning is emphasized and encouraged. An important aspect of learning is stretching yourself in ways you haven't done before. When you are doing that, it is simply natural to make mistakes along the way.

A healthy work culture should not shun mistakes. If you're not making mistakes, you aren't challenging yourself. If you aren't challenging yourself, you aren't growing. If you aren't growing, you are dead. Unless it is a monopoly, a company is likely to be taken over by competitors and perish if it's not growing.

TODO (the important part is learning from your mistakes)

TODO (individual growth; collective responsibility; company like a "society of minds" (book reference); the capabilities of the larger company are greater than the sum of its parts; emergent-culture; company-impacting mistakes are often reflective of the larger culture and should be treated as such, not finger-pointing and scapegoating).

TODO (the Five whys and the benefit of proper postmortems).

TODO (if employees are constantly worried about making mistakes and getting in trouble, they are NOT going to be giving you their best effort or best work)
