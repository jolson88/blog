# The Journey of Discovery Newsletter
My newsletter does not aim to sell anything. There are no ads, and I care deeply for your privacy. Your email will never be shared with any 3rd party. This newsletter is powered by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com).

My newsletter aims to be a high-signal, low-noise newsletter. It is low traffic and is sent out once a month. It is not simply a digest of blog posts. I aim to provide a high quality list of the things that I'm reading and learning about. These are the cool things that are shaping my thinking and helping contribute to what I discuss on my blog. YouTube videos, other blog posts, academic papers, books... all the cool things I've collected over the last month.
