I am a back-end systems developer by day at Concur, husband/father-of-two/musician by night. I love all things programming, music, art, and science.

I am really passionate about distributed computing and cloud-based technology and love building back-end systems that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable. My current technology passions are: Functional programming, Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript, Haskell, Erlang / Elixir, Linux, Docker, CoreOS, NoSQL databases, etc.

I enjoy challenging work that requires teamwork, communication skills, cross-discipline interaction, leadership, and deep thinking. I also really enjoy being “smack dab in the middle” of critical business products and contributing to the core value of a business.

Active in the tech community as a writer and speaker, I have delivered talks at Microsoft //Build (2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015), TechEd North America, TechEd Europe, internal Microsoft conferences, and many .NET user groups over the years. I’ve appeared as a guest on podcasts like .NET Rocks and Hanselminutes, produced shows for Channel 9 on MSDN, and written articles for MSDN magazine.
